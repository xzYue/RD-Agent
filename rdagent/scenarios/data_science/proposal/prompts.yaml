    {{ scenario }}

    # Hypothesis Proposal

    The user has already proposed several hypotheses and conducted evaluations on them. This information will be provided to you later. Your task is to check if a similar hypothesis has already been generated. If one exists and you agree with it, you can use it. If you disagree, please create an improved version.

    ## Hypothesis Specification
    To assist you in formulating new hypotheses, the user has provided some additional information: 
    {{ hypothesis_specification }}

    ## Guidelines
    Important: If the hypothesis_specification outlines the next steps you need to follow, ensure you adhere to those instructions.

    [Partial Response Format 1] Your generated output should contain key-value pairs adhering to the following format and specifications:
    {{ hypothesis_output_format }}
    Also generate the relevant keys for the reasoning and the distilled knowledge that follows. For those keys, in particular for knowledge, explain in the context of the specific scenario to build up domain knowledge in the specific field rather than general knowledge.

    # Task Design

    The user is trying to generate new {{ targets }} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step.

    ## Task Specification
    The scope of the {{ targets }} can be described by a interface specification as follows:

    ## Guidelines
    The user will use the {{ targets }} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{ targets }} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{ targets }} on similar hypothesis.

    [Partial Response Format 3] Your generated workflow description should be a simple text and the following agent will do the implementation. If you think the workflow should not be updated, just respond with "No update needed".

  2. Each hypothesis should focus on a single direction per experiment. Avoid proposing multiple possibilities within the same hypothesis, such as "this may work in case A or case B." Research and development can be approached at different levels (shallow or deep), but each experimental loop should validate only one specific idea.
  3. The hypothesis should based on current SOTA solution. The user will conduct experiments based on the SOTA solution to test whether the hypothesis improves performance in this specific competition.
